## Getting Started

To use these scripts in Adobe Photoshop, follow the instructions below:

1. Open Adobe Photoshop.
2. Go to `File` > `Scripts` > `Browse`.
3. Navigate to the location where you saved the script, select it, and click `Open`.

I do recommend Brusherator from scripts you use frequently.

## Scripts

### 1. Get Number of Selected Layers

This script retrieves the number of currently selected layers in the active Photoshop document and displays it in an alert box. 
This is useful if you are working on a number of items/layers and you must be sure you didn't skip any. (i.e you must have exactly 30 layers)

#### Description:

- **Purpose:** Displays the number of selected layers in the active Photoshop document.
- **Usage:** Select multiple layers in your Photoshop document, run the script, and an alert will show the number of selected layers.
